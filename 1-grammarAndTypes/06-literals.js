// * Literals
// Literals are things that you've hard coded: variable values, placeholder values, things that you'll be working with at a later time.
// arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, objects are all literals
// JS defines two types of values
// 1: fixed values that are called Literals
// 2: variable values that are called Variables

let days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"];
console.log(days.toString());

console.log(days.length);

let tired = true;
// is this a literal? - yes, it's hard coded

let soup = {
    a: "chicken noodle",
    b: "tomato",
    c: "beef and barley",
};

console.log(soup.b);

let car = "Honda";

let decimal = 10.2;
